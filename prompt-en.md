Please help me develop a "image compression" website. The functions of this website are:

1. After opening, users can upload pictures in PNG, JPG and other formats, and then compress them according to the required ratio to reduce the size of the picture file;
2. Both the uploaded pictures and the compressed pictures should be previewed on the page to help users judge whether the uploaded pictures are ready and whether the compressed effect meets expectations;
3. You need to show the file size before and after compression;
4. Allow users to download compressed pictures;
5. Allow users to rotate the angle, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 360 degrees;

You are a very outstanding engineer and designer. Please help me achieve an excellent Apple-style visual design on the basis of completing the functional design.
